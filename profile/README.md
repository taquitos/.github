Scaling up Xcode projects is a tedious undertaking: *Git conflicts in `.pbxproj` files, slow Xcode, large build times, and brittle projects that break easily when adding/removing targets to its graph.*
This often leads to developer frustration, and the companies that can afford it, create infrastructure teams dedicated to mitigate those pains. In few cases, the pain is mitigated with the complexity of alternative build systems like [Bazel](https://bazel.build/).

We believe painless Xcode development with large projects can be **enjoyable** and **simple.**
